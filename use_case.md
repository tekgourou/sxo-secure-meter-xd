Secure Meter XD (written SMXD)
=====================================

Automated private security intelligence framework to help automate internal observable judgements to improve alert fidelity and automated response inside of SecureX Orchestrator.

Some highlights of the use case:

* Give the ability to security analyst to respond manually to a threat based on internal observable disposition. Per example, before disabling a user in Cisco Secure Access by Duo the security analyst want to make sure more than 3 frauds authentication events has been received. (User observable = Suspicious)* Track Access Device and Auth Device IP and or country mismatch (find anomalies that could indicate compromises);
* Let's Cisco SecureX Orchestration respond automatically to a threat based on internal observable disposition. Per example, before put Cisco Secure Enpoint in isolation mode only after 5 security events from any Security events sources like Meraki SM, Cisco Secure Enpoint, ISE, Duo, etc. (hostname observable = Malicious)
